## About

Flowloop is a productivity timer that helps you maintain a [state of flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). It's based on the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). Unlike Pomodoro however, Flowloop keeps you aware of time without having to interrupt you.

- Every 25 minutes of uninterrupted work time is **1 lap**. A bell sound will be played when you finish a lap.

- The next lap will sound 1 more bell than the last, as long as your work is not interrupted. That is: 1 bell for the first lap, 2 bells for the second, and so on. This keeps you aware of how long you've been working.

- You can take a break any time you wish for as long as you want. Increasing number of bells will also play every 5 minutes to remind you to get back to work.

- Flowloop will keep a list of all your completed laps every day. This lets you see how productive you've been throughout the day and week.

## Rationale

Flowloop was born out of the frustration of Pomodoro timers all imposing 5-minute distraction breaks just as you're starting to get focused. I prefer a timer that gently reminds me of time spent, rather than one that requires my input 4 times in an hour.

Use Flowloop for:

- __Motivate yourself.__ By keeping a list of laps over the last week, you'll be giving yourself a subtle push of encouragement to perform as much as yesterday, if not better.

- __Manage distractions.__ By clearly designating time periods as for work and break, it helps you be more productive in your work and enjoy your breaks better.

- __Schedule work better.__ You'll be able to do around 10 laps in one typical work day. Awareness of laps will help you schedule your time wisely.
